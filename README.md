# Determination of Governing Equations and Conserved Quantities Using Lagrangian Neural Networks

Hi, welcome to the repository for my project for Machine Learning II (CS 5806). This project covers a new and exciting type of neural network that predicts the Lagrangian of a given physical system, called a "Lagrangian Neural Network", or LNN for short. In this study, I look into a small extension of the use case of LNNs: determining the governing equation of the predicted system, and determining if there are any conserved quantities.

You can find all of the relevant code in the `LNN.ipynb` file, and any extra functions in the `utils.py` file.

Thanks for checking this project out!
